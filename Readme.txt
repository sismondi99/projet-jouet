Projet jouet

The aim goal was to build a website for selling with two accounts, seller and client.

We used MERN to do this project,The project consists of two parts: back-end and front-end. 
In order to start the back and front we used concurrently to do that, so you can
use "npm i && npm start" to start the front and back.
If not supported pls follow:
1.cd back
2.npm i 
3.npm run dev 
4.cd ../front 
5.npm i 
6.npm start

Generally, the browser will automatically jump to our page after the service is started. 
If not, please open localhost:3000 manually.
We don't have a main interface in the usual sense, you can see the products 
after you complete the registration/login. 

You can use the following accounts to test:
Buyer:buyerkuma@gmail.com pwd:123456
Seller:seller1@gmail.com pwd:123456

You can also choose to register buyers/sellers through 
the registration page.
Since the product requires the seller to confirm the delivery before 
the buyer can evaluate it, it is necessary to switch accounts to conduct the evaluation.
If you have any questions, 

Thx!
